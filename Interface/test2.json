The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible.

Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",

        "Elasticsearch is used for a lot of different use cases: \"classical\" full text search, analytics store, auto completer, spell checker, alerting engine, and as a general purpose document store. This article gives a brief overview of different common uses and important things to consider, with pointers to where you can learn more about them.",
        "Autocompleting searches while also showing the results for the most likely completed search, much like how Google does it, should be considered as two separate search problems. The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows.

        "Elasticsearch is still fairly young, and our customers tend to start with Elasticsearch for a certain project, and then later pile on with more clusters for logging and analytics as well.",
        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",
        "Modern search interfaces are generally expected to have some sort of faceted navigation, i.e. where a user can get a quick understanding of the distribution of the search results. How many books are of a particular author, in a certain price range, with a certain rating? These are implemented using aggregations in Elasticsearch, and they come in many forms. You can aggregate on terms, numerical ranges, date ranges, geo distance, and a lot more.",
        "Searching while the user types comes in many forms. It can be simple suggestions of e.g. existing tags, trying to predict a search based on search history, or just doing a completely new search for every (throttled) keystroke.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",
        "You probably should not make one index per user for your multi-tenant application.",
        "Related to user defined schemas is often the need to let end users define their own searches, with custom filters, scoring and aggregations. One common approach is to limit the search request to certain indexes, and/or wrap the users query with filters."

        "What's new in Elastic Cloud for 7.13.0",
        "Elasticsearch is used for a lot of different use cases: \"classical\" full text search, analytics store, auto completer, spell checker, alerting engine, and as a general purpose document store. This article gives a brief overview of different common uses and important things to consider, with pointers to where you can learn more about them.",
        "Elasticsearch is still fairly young, and our customers tend to start with Elasticsearch for a certain project, and then later pile on with more clusters for logging and analytics as well.",
        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",
        "You can use Elasticsearch for all of this, and more, but the different uses come with vastly different levels of complexity and resource requirements.",
        "You Know, For Search! (And Counting!)",
        "Searching while the user types comes in many forms. It can be simple suggestions of e.g. existing tags, trying to predict a search based on search history, or just doing a completely new search for every (throttled) keystroke.",
        "Searches like this are very sensitive to latencies. The threshold of what no longer feels “instant” is generally considered to be 100 milliseconds. Searching for almost every keystroke also means quite a higher search throughput as well. Thus, it’s essential that the searches are cheap and that these indexes fit in memory.",
        "Autocompleting searches while also showing the results for the most likely completed search, much like how Google does it, should be considered as two separate search problems. The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",
        "You probably should not make one index per user for your multi-tenant application.",
        "Related to having multiple individual customers, we also see a lot of use cases where different users can have completely different documents. For example, if you are providing user surveys/questionnaires as a service, it’s likely that different surveys have completely different fields.",

What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",

        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters."

        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",
        "Searches like this are very sensitive to latencies. The threshold of what no longer feels “instant” is generally considered to be 100 milliseconds. Searching for almost every keystroke also means quite a higher search throughput as well. Thus, it’s essential that the searches are cheap and that these indexes fit in memory.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",

Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

        "Elasticsearch is used for a lot of different use cases: \"classical\" full text search, analytics store, auto completer, spell checker, alerting engine, and as a general purpose document store. This article gives a brief overview of different common uses and important things to consider, with pointers to where you can learn more about them.",
        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",
        "Modern search interfaces are generally expected to have some sort of faceted navigation, i.e. where a user can get a quick understanding of the distribution of the search results. How many books are of a particular author, in a certain price range, with a certain rating? These are implemented using aggregations in Elasticsearch, and they come in many forms. You can aggregate on terms, numerical ranges, date ranges, geo distance, and a lot more.",
        "Often, you have multiple customers or users with separate collections of documents, and a user should never be able to search documents that do not belong to him. This often leads to a design where every user has his own index.",
        "Related to having multiple individual customers, we also see a lot of use cases where different users can have completely different documents. For example, if you are providing user surveys/questionnaires as a service, it’s likely that different surveys have completely different fields."

Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well.",

        "Searches like this are very sensitive to latencies. The threshold of what no longer feels “instant” is generally considered to be 100 milliseconds. Searching for almost every keystroke also means quite a higher search throughput as well. Thus, it’s essential that the searches are cheap and that these indexes fit in memory.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",
        "Often, you have multiple customers or users with separate collections of documents, and a user should never be able to search documents that do not belong to him. This often leads to a design where every user has his own index.",
        "Related to having multiple individual customers, we also see a lot of use cases where different users can have completely different documents. For example, if you are providing user surveys/questionnaires as a service, it’s likely that different surveys have completely different fields."

Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",

Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume.

The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",

Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

You can aggregate on terms, numerical ranges, date ranges, geo distance, and a lot more.",
        "Searching while the user types comes in many forms. It can be simple suggestions of e.g. existing tags, trying to predict a search based on search history, or just doing a completely new search for every (throttled) keystroke.",

Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters."

        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

        "A common development evolution starts with building a simple search for a web site or a document collection. Then, perhaps faceted navigation is added, and spell checking or “did you mean?” responses. Maybe fuzzy searching is warranted, and auto completion, possibly even “search as you type”. Since relevancy is important, more advanced ranking schemes are likely to be added eventually — possibly based on who the user is, where she is, or who she knows. And of course, to know what the users actually do, usage must be logged — and metrics stored, so we know everything performs well."

        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

        "Modern search interfaces are generally expected to have some sort of faceted navigation, i.e. where a user can get a quick understanding of the distribution of the search results. How many books are of a particular author, in a certain price range, with a certain rating? These are implemented using aggregations in Elasticsearch, and they come in many forms. You can aggregate on terms, numerical ranges, date ranges, geo distance, and a lot more.",
        "Autocompleting searches while also showing the results for the most likely completed search, much like how Google does it, should be considered as two separate search problems. The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”."

        "Searches like this are very sensitive to latencies. The threshold of what no longer feels “instant” is generally considered to be 100 milliseconds. Searching for almost every keystroke also means quite a higher search throughput as well. Thus, it’s essential that the searches are cheap and that these indexes fit in memory.",
        "Autocompleting searches while also showing the results for the most likely completed search, much like how Google does it, should be considered as two separate search problems. The amount of data to be searched when autocompleting previous searches is probably a lot less than the content being searched, which makes keeping it all in memory and serving fuzzy searches more feasible. Since an autocomplete search will see a lot higher search load than the full search, keeping the two separate makes it possible to scale them separately as well, possibly in completely separate Elasticsearch clusters.",
        "When Soundcloud revamped their search experience, they worked a lot on search suggestions. Implementing it well, they not only saw an increase in search precision, but also a noticable reduction in load on the infrastructure powering the full search. What people search for often follows a Zipf distribution: typically, 10% of the unique searches account for 90% of the search volume. Thus, it’s very likely that the full results for the best search suggestion is already cached (in your application layer), and can be displayed “instantly”.",
        "Related to having multiple individual customers, we also see a lot of use cases where different users can have completely different documents. For example, if you are providing user surveys/questionnaires as a service, it’s likely that different surveys have completely different fields."
